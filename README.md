## Free 5G memory for everyone

This repository gives 5G RAM for your laptop or server.
It's totally free for everyone. We only support `Linux`
or `Mac` machines.

## Usage

When your laptop or server is running slow, it's a good sign you
need more memory. You can type the following command to see

    $ free -m
    $ top
    $ htop

If you decide to have more memory, you can simply download 5G more!

    $ curl -Lso 5G https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icy/ram_free5G/master/5G

Now you can do whatever with want with the downloaded file.
For example, to save "Hello world" in the newly downloaded memory

    $ echo "Hello, world" > 5G
